# Boccia MCU

This project contains the files for the firmware portion of the Boccia project.
The folders are divided into the following:
- [Boccia-controller](/boccia-controller/). The Boccia controller folder is a [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) project that includes all the necessary files for the firwmare.
- [Examples](./Examples/). Has multiple subfolders with Arduino IDE projects to test individual portions of the firmware


# Notes
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) requires the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) to be installed.
- When developing for the main project, in Visual Studio Code open the [boccia controller](/boccia-controller/) folder directly with the following shortcut:
```
Windows:  Ctrl + K, Ctrl + O
